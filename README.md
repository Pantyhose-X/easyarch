# easyarch
nothing big, just for when I want to setup arch linux, it automates it to my liking. credit to ArchTitus.
the main thing i changed was to make the UEFI partition 2G instead of 300M.

```
pacman -Sy git
git clone https://github.com/F1uk369/easyarch/
cd easyarch
chmod +x easyarch.sh
./easyarch.sh
```
